### Notes

- `three/addons` files used in threejs examples live in `examples/jsm` repo directory
- json-exported font paths live in repo direcotry `examples/fonts`

## demos

 - demo_box - three js spinning box demo
 - demo_text - three js text rendering demo

## trials

 - rectangle_anim - trivial rectangle animation
 - grid_layout - just a grid drawing
 - grid_anim_three - simple use of modern three js animation clip / keyframe track system
 - grid_anim_tween - simple use of tween.js to animate... it's a bit underwhelming, chaining is wonky.
